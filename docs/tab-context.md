# Tab Context
The Tab Context menu is the menu the appears when you right-click or context-click on a file tab. This menu is not modifyable, however commands can be added to it.

## Adding commands
Since ID properties have been added to each of the commands in the tab context, you can add commands before/after or even between the defaults.
