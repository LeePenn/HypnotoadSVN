HypnotoadSVN 1.4.0
==================

Features
--------
- Added native command "Move"
- Added preliminary support for external diff programs
- Revert All can now always be enabled as a shortcut

Installation Notes
------------------
New commands have been added; you can add them to your side bar file in one of 2 ways:
- run the "HypnotoadSVN: Reset Side Bar" command from the command palette
- manual copy the commands from the "Side Bar - Default" file to the "Side Bar - User" file

If you have not modified your side bar, then it is recommended that you run the reset command.
